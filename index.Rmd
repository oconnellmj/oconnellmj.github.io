I am originally from Ohio and earned my Bachelor's degree at Miami University in 2013. After getting my Ph.D. in biostatistics at the University of Minnesota, I returned to Miami as a faculty member in the Department of Statistics in 2018. My research mostly falls under the areas of dimension reduction and bioinformatics. I have also recently been working with methods for zero-inflated data. 

Outside of work, I love playing and watching football. Being from the Cincinnati area, I am a huge Bengals fan. My wife is from Minnesota, so we also follow the Vikings. You may see me using NFL data from time-to-time for in-class examples, and I have occasionally dabbled in sports analytics projects. When I was in graduate school, I led a flag football team of all biostatistics students to an intramural championship. 

Another hobby that I have is music. I played trombone in the Miami University Marching Band when I was a student, and I also participated in Steel Band, Symphony Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band, and Pep Band. I also enjoy playing guitar.
